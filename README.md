# Arcana Agent Framework 1

This project is designed to provide a framework for building intelligent agents. It includes modules for agent communication, decision-making, and learning.

## Project Structure
- `agents/`: Contains agent implementations.
- `communication/`: Handles message passing between agents.
- `decision_making/`: Algorithms and strategies for agent decision-making.
- `learning/`: Machine learning models and utilities for agents.

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies using the provided `requirements.txt`.
3. Run the example agent to see the framework in action.

## Requirements
- Python 3.8+

## Installation
To install the necessary dependencies, run:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
To run the example agent:
```
python agents/example_agent.py
```

## Current Status

The Arcana Agent Framework is in active development, focusing on providing a robust platform for creating and managing intelligent agents. The framework supports:

- **Agent Communication**: Facilitates message passing and interaction between agents.
- **Task Management**: Allows agents to perform and coordinate tasks efficiently.
- **Natural Language Processing**: Integrates NLP capabilities for understanding and generating human language.
- **Visualization Tools**: Includes tools for visualizing agent interactions and task assignments.

### Recent Updates
- Implemented a command-line interface for agent interaction.
- Added a GUI for user-friendly testing and debugging.
- Developed a visualization module to simulate and display agent communications.

The framework is designed to be extensible, allowing developers to integrate custom agents and modules to suit specific needs. Future updates will focus on enhancing scalability and adding more advanced machine learning models.

## Project Overview
The Arcana Agent Framework is a flexible, modular agent-based system designed for intelligent task management and communication. It supports dynamic agent creation, task decomposition, and interactive visualization of agent interactions.

## Installation Instructions
1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ArcanaAgentFramework.git
   ```
2. **Navigate to the project directory**:
   ```bash
   cd ArcanaAgentFramework
   ```
3. **Set up a virtual environment**:
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `.venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```
4. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage Examples
- **Start the CLI**:
  Run the main script to interact with the CLI:
  ```bash
  python3 main.py
  ```
- **Interact with Agents**:
  Use the CLI to send commands and manage tasks interactively.

## API Reference
- **AgentManager**: Handles agent registration, task decomposition, and message passing.
- **TaskAgent**: Specialized agent for processing tasks based on intents.
- **Visualization**: Provides graphical representation of agent interactions.
